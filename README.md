## Requirement

* Python >= v3

You need to setup a virtual environment first. Make sure you are running python version >= 3. run the following command to check 

```
python --version
```

if the result is python version 2, then use this command

```
python3 --version
```

## Setting up a virtual environment

if the result above is python version >= 3.0, then run the following command to set up a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv env
```

> **Note:** Whichever command shows python version >= 3.0 is the one to use in the command above and this should be run in the command prompt or terminal or powershell for windows.
>
> Once setup, you don't need to run the above command everytime unless you are re-initiating the virtual environment

## Activating virtual environment

> **Note:** This has to be done everytime you are working on the project so that every developer will have a consistent environment. Navigate to the $PROJECT_DIRECTORY

For windows OS, run

```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

For MacOS or Linux, run

```
source env/bin/activate
```
